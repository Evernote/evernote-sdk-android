Evernote SDK for Android version 1.0
====================================

Evernote API version 1.23

Notice
------
This is a non-backwards compatible update.  Please `git pull` before following setup instructions.

Overview
--------
This SDK wraps the [Evernote Cloud API ](http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud/) and provides OAuth authentication functionality. The SDK is provided as an Android Library project that can be included in your application.

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to use the code in this SDK, you need to obtain an API key from http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud. You'll also find full API documentation on that page.

In order to run the sample code, you need a user account on the sandbox service where you will do your development. Sign up for an account at https://sandbox.evernote.com/Registration.action

The instructions below assume that you are developing your Android app in Eclipse and have the [latest Android development tools](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html).

Running the sample app from Eclipse
-----------------------------------
The sample application HelloEDAM demonstrates how to use the Evernote SDK for Android to authentication to the Evernote service using OAuth, then access the user's Evernote account. To build and run the sample project from Eclipse:

1. Open Eclipse
2. From the File menu, choose New and then Project...
3. Under Android, select "Android Project from Existing Code" and click Next
4. Click Browse
5. Select the SDK root directory (the directory containing this README) and click Open
6. Click Finish
7. From the Package Explorer, expand the HelloEDAM project's `src` directory and open `com.evernote.android.sample.HelloEDAM.java`
8. At the top of `HelloEDAM.java`, fill in your Evernote API consumer key and secret.
9. Build and run the project

The sample application allows you to authenticate to Evernote, select an image from your device's image gallery, and then save that image into Evernote as a new note.

Using the SDK in your app
-------------------------
There are two ways to include the SDK in your project: by including and building the Android Library Project or by using Maven.

### Include the Android Library Project in your Eclipse workspace

1. Import the Android Library Project
   1. Open Eclipse
   2. From the File menu, choose New and then Project...
   3. Under Android, select "Android Project from Existing Code" and click Next
   4. Click Browse
   5. Select the library directory and click Open
   6. Click Finish
1. Add the Android Library Project as a dependency in your app
   7. Right-click on your project and choose "Properties"
   8. In the Android section, in the Library area, click Add...
   9. Select library from the list and click OK
   10. Click Java Build Path and then select the Projects tab
   11. Click Add...
   12. Select Library and click OK
   13. Click OK

### Use Maven

If you build your app using Maven, you can simply add the Evernote SDK for Android as a dependency in your pom.xml.

Add the Evernote SDK for Android as a dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.evernote</groupId>
	<artifactId>android-sdk</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.1</version>
	<type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

### Modify your `AndroidManifest.xml`

The SDK's OAuth functionality is implemented as an Android Activity that must be declared in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml`. Simply copy and paste the following snippet into your `AndroidManifest.xml` within the application section:

```xml
<activity android:name="com.evernote.client.oauth.android.EvernoteOAuthActivity" />
```

### Set up an `EvernoteSession`

Define your app credentials (key, secret, and host).  See http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud/

```java
private static final String CONSUMER_KEY = "Your consumer key";
private static final String CONSUMER_SECRET = "Your consumer secret";
private static final String EVERNOTE_HOST = EvernoteSession.HOST_SANDBOX;
```

When your app starts, initialize the EvernoteSession singleton that has all of the information that is needed to authenticate to Evernote.

```java
mEvernoteSession = EvernoteSession.init(this, CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, EVERNOTE_HOST, null);
```

### Give the user a way to initiate authentication

In our sample app, we have a "Sign in to Evernote" button that initiates the authentication process. You might choose to do something similar, or you might simply initiate authentication the first time that the user tries to access Evernote-related functionality.

```java
mEvernoteSession.authenticate(this);
```
### Complete authentication in `onActivityResult`

You can check whether authentication was successful by watching for the Evernote OAuth Activity in `onActivityResult`. If authentication is successful, you can start using the Evernote API.

```java
@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
  switch(requestCode) {
    // Update UI when oauth activity returns result
    case EvernoteSession.REQUEST_CODE_OAUTH:
      if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        // Authentication was successful, do what you need to do in your app
      }
      break;
  }
}
```

### Get a `NoteStore.Client` from the `EvernoteSessio`n and make Evernote API calls

After you've authenticated, the EvernoteSession will have a valid authentication token. Use the session to get a `NoteStore` or `UserStore` client object, and pass the session's authentication token when calling `NoteStore`/`UserStore` methods. See `saveImage()` in the sample application for an example of creating a new note using the API. Browse the JavaDoc at http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/reference/javadoc/
